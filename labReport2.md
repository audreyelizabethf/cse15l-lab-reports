## Part 3
One thing I learned from labs in weeks 2 and 3 was how to build and run a server. I liked learning how to build a server and run it locally on a port. Up until now, I could only see the output of my code from the terminal in VSCode, so I think it is really cool that now I can input and see the output from my browser.
